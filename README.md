This project is in-depth analysis of the Santa Clara Crime Dataset, which encompasses 194,865 police response occurrences in Santa Clara County, California, recorded from August 1, 2017, to December 15, 2019. The dataset 'santa-clara-country-crime' contains 194,865 observations of unique police response occurrences in Santa Clara County, California. It has 20 descriptor fields, including date, time of the incident, type, and location of incident. There are 27 types of primary crime incidents recorded from August 1st, 2017, to December 15th, 2019, for 867 calendar days. There are five one-day gaps and one five-day gap, between Jan.30 and Feb.5, 2018, in these recordings.

The analysis focuses on understanding temporal patterns and forecasting future occurrences for a total of sixteen time series. The statistical methods employed were data transformation to stationarity, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Seasonality, ARMA and SARIMA, and Generalized Auto Regressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity GARCH.

Project Motivation
There has been a call to action to reform the public policies in the Bay Area, particularly in criminal justice. The crime rate has been in the national and local news with a bias favoring a “tough on crime” approach. As my family is working in high-tech and living in Santa Clara County, it is experiencing a perception of higher-than-normal crime rates. That may be fueled by news correspondents.
This project deploys a detailed analysis of the data to answer the question: “Is crime really on the rise?”
